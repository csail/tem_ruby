This is the ruby driver for the Trusted Execution Module prototype produced at
MIT. The best features of the ruby driver are the very powerful DSL
(domain-specific language) that TEM SECpacks are compiled from, and the
usage of debugging line info to translate exception IPs to stack traces.

Running coverage tests:
gem install rcov
rcov -Ilib test/*.rb
